window.SIDEBAR_ITEMS = {"enum":[["BodyResolver","The `BodyResolver` allows mapping a `BodyId` to the corresponding `hir::Body`. We could also just store a plain reference to the `hir::Crate` but we want to avoid that the crate is used to get untracked access to all of the HIR."]],"struct":[["StableHashingContext","This is the context state available during incr. comp. hashing. It contains enough information to transform `DefId`s and `HirId`s into stable `DefPath`s (i.e., a reference to the `TyCtxt`) and it holds a few caches for speeding up various things (e.g., each `DefId`/`DefPath` is only hashed once)."]]};
