Ideally we would like to track multiple determining places for some edge cases, but one is enough for a lot of situations."],["is_likely_const","This function describes a rough heuristic guessing whether a place is last set with a const within the block. Notably, it will be overly pessimistic in cases that are already not handled by `separate_const_switch`."],["separate_const_switch","Returns the amount of blocks that were duplicated"]],"struct":[["SeparateConstSwitch",""]]};
