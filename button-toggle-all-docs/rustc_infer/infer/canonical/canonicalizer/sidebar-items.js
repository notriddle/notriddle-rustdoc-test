This depends on what we are canonicalizing for – e.g., if we are canonicalizing to create a query, we want to replace those with inference variables, since we want to make a maximally general query. But if we are canonicalizing a query response, then we don’t typically replace free regions, as they must have been introduced from other parts of the system."]]};
