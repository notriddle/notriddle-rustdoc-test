The mid-point is the point just before the statement takes effect; in particular, for an assignment `A = B`, it is the point where B is about to be written into A. This mid-point is a kind of hack to work around our inability to track the position information at sufficient granularity through outlives relations; however, the rich location table serves another purpose: it compresses locations from multiple words into a single u32."],["RustcFacts",""]],"type":[["PoloniusInput",""],["PoloniusOutput",""]]};
