///
/// All flavors of MIR use the same data structure, but there are some important differences. These
/// differences come in two forms: Dialects and phases.
///
/// Dialects represent a stronger distinction than phases. This is because the transitions between
/// dialects are semantic changes, and therefore technically *lowerings* between distinct IRs. In
/// other words, the same [`Body`](crate::mir::Body) might be well-formed for multiple dialects, but
/// have different semantic meaning and different behavior at runtime.
///
/// Each dialect additionally has a number of phases. However, phase changes never involve semantic
/// changes. If some MIR is well-formed both before and after a phase change, it is also guaranteed
/// that it has the same semantic meaning. In this sense, phase changes can only add additional
/// restrictions on what MIR is well-formed.
///
/// When adding phases, remember to update [`MirPhase::phase_index`].

    ///    not be executed. The exact semantics of this aren&#39;t written down anywhere, which means they

    ///    when a `Drop` terminator is reached, if the type has drop glue that drop glue is always
    ///    executed. This may be UB if the underlying place is not initialized.
    ///  - Packed drops: Places might in general be misaligned - in most cases this is UB, the exception
    ///    is fields of packed structs. In analysis MIR, `Drop(P)` for a `P` that might be misaligned
    ///    for this reason implicitly moves `P` to a temporary before dropping. Runtime MIR has no such
    ///    rules, and dropping a misaligned place is simply UB.
    ///  - Unwinding: in analysis MIR, unwinding from a function which may not unwind aborts. In runtime
    ///    MIR, this is UB.
    ///  - Retags: If `-Zmir-emit-retag` is enabled, analysis MIR has &quot;implicit&quot; retags in the same way
    ///    that Rust itself has them. Where exactly these are is generally subject to change, and so we
    ///    don&#39;t document this here. Runtime MIR has all retags explicit.
    ///  - Generator bodies: In analysis MIR, locals may actually be behind a pointer that user code has
    ///    access to. This occurs in generator bodies. Such locals do not behave like other locals,
    ///    because they eg may be aliased in surprising ways. Runtime MIR has no such special locals -
    ///    all generator bodies are lowered and so all places that look like locals really are locals.

// Places

</span><span class="doccomment">/// Places roughly correspond to a &quot;location in memory.&quot; Places in MIR are the same mathematical
/// object as places in Rust. This of course means that what exactly they are is undecided and part
/// of the Rust memory model. However, they will likely contain at least the following pieces of
/// information in some form:
///
///  1. The address in memory that the place refers to.
///  2. The provenance with which the place is being accessed.
///  3. The type of the place and an optional variant index. See [`PlaceTy`][super::tcx::PlaceTy].
///  4. Optionally, some metadata. This exists if and only if the type of the place is not `Sized`.
///
/// We&#39;ll give a description below of how all pieces of the place except for the provenance are
/// calculated. We cannot give a description of the provenance, because that is part of the
/// undecided aliasing model - we only include it here at all to acknowledge its existence.
///
/// Each local naturally corresponds to the place `Place { local, projection: [] }`. This place has
/// the address of the local&#39;s allocation and the type of the local.
///
/// **Needs clarification:** Unsized locals seem to present a bit of an issue. Their allocation
/// can&#39;t actually be created on `StorageLive`, because it&#39;s unclear how big to make the allocation.
/// Furthermore, MIR produces assignments to unsized locals, although that is not permitted under
/// `#![feature(unsized_locals)]` in Rust. Besides just putting &quot;unsized locals are special and
/// different&quot; in a bunch of places, I (JakobDegen) don&#39;t know how to incorporate this behavior into
/// the current MIR semantics in a clean way - possibly this needs some design work first.
///
/// For places that are not locals, ie they have a non-empty list of projections, we define the
/// values as a function of the parent place, that is the place with its last [`ProjectionElem`]
/// stripped. The way this is computed of course depends on the kind of that last projection
/// element:
///
///  - [`Downcast`](ProjectionElem::Downcast): This projection sets the place&#39;s variant index to the
///    given one, and makes no other changes. A `Downcast` projection on a place with its variant
///    index already set is not well-formed.
///  - [`Field`](ProjectionElem::Field): `Field` projections take their parent place and create a
///    place referring to one of the fields of the type. The resulting address is the parent
///    address, plus the offset of the field. The type becomes the type of the field. If the parent
///    was unsized and so had metadata associated with it, then the metadata is retained if the
///    field is unsized and thrown out if it is sized.
///
///    These projections are only legal for tuples, ADTs, closures, and generators. If the ADT or
///    generator has more than one variant, the parent place&#39;s variant index must be set, indicating
///    which variant is being used. If it has just one variant, the variant index may or may not be
///    included - the single possible variant is inferred if it is not included.
///  - [`ConstantIndex`](ProjectionElem::ConstantIndex): Computes an offset in units of `T` into the
///    place as described in the documentation for the `ProjectionElem`. The resulting address is
///    the parent&#39;s address plus that offset, and the type is `T`. This is only legal if the parent
///    place has type `[T;  N]` or `[T]` (*not* `&amp;[T]`). Since such a `T` is always sized, any
///    resulting metadata is thrown out.
///  - [`Subslice`](ProjectionElem::Subslice): This projection calculates an offset and a new
///    address in a similar manner as `ConstantIndex`. It is also only legal on `[T; N]` and `[T]`.
///    However, this yields a `Place` of type `[T]`, and additionally sets the metadata to be the
///    length of the subslice.
///  - [`Index`](ProjectionElem::Index): Like `ConstantIndex`, only legal on `[T; N]` or `[T]`.
///    However, `Index` additionally takes a local from which the value of the index is computed at
///    runtime. Computing the value of the index involves interpreting the `Local` as a
///    `Place { local, projection: [] }`, and then computing its value as if done via
///    [`Operand::Copy`]. The array/slice is then indexed with the resulting value. The local must
///    have type `usize`.
///  - [`Deref`](ProjectionElem::Deref): Derefs are the last type of projection, and the most
///    complicated. They are only legal on parent places that are references, pointers, or `Box`. A
///    `Deref` projection begins by loading a value from the parent place, as if by
///    [`Operand::Copy`]. It then dereferences the resulting pointer, creating a place of the
///    pointee&#39;s type. The resulting address is the address that was stored in the pointer. If the
///    pointee type is unsized, the pointer additionally stored the value of the metadata.
///
/// Computing a place may cause UB. One possibility is that the pointer used for a `Deref` may not
/// be suitably aligned. Another possibility is that the place is not in bounds, meaning it does not
/// point to an actual allocation.
///
/// However, if this is actually UB and when the UB kicks in is undecided. This is being discussed
/// in [UCG#319]. The options include that every place must obey those rules, that only some places
/// must obey them, or that places impose no rules of their own.
///
/// [UCG#319]: https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/319
///
/// Rust currently requires that every place obey those two rules. This is checked by MIRI and taken
/// advantage of by codegen (via `gep inbounds`). That is possibly subject to change.
